      Judging Criteria
    
    
  

  
      
        Delightful UX
        Games should be intuitive and built with accessible layouts and themes. It should be exciting and easy to uncover what the app has to offer. We will be testing apps on Desktop, but encourage devs to consider the mobile layout and experience of their app.
      
      
        Relevance
        Does the app leverage the Developer Platform interactive post features to create a thought-out game? See examples of apps that use the interactive post feature here: https://developers.reddit.com/docs/showcase/apps.
      
      
        Original
        WeÃ¢ÂÂre not looking for simple clones of existing apps. We want these apps to have their own identity and look, or bring a new twist to a classic game. Make it sleek, make it weird, make it fun, and make it unique! 
      
      
        Uniquely suited to Reddit
        Your game should be designed to bring together a community of users. Think massively multiplayer. Make use of flair, comments, leaderboards, or other Reddit-y mechanics. See the recommended list of mechanics for more guidance on the Resources page.

        What to BuildÃÂ 
Businesses worldwide are losing valuable time, money and opportunities because agreement data is trapped in inefficient systems, hindering decision-making and delaying processes, known as the Agreement Trap. To illustrate the agreement trap, if you send Terms and Conditions to 1,000 partners or customers annually, tracking expiration dates for renewals becomes a challenge. The key lies in the data within these agreements.
Hackathon developers should create solutions that enable businesses to streamline workflows and automate processes that maximize the value of their agreement data. Your challenge: develop a project that that addresses the agreement trap in one of the following categories:

AI-ify Your World - Use AI to unlock insights from your Docusign agreements and build innovative solutions.
Hack-for-Good -ÃÂ Build an innovative solution with Docusign's developer platform to help a non-profit achieve its mission.
Making the Impossible...Possible - Use Docusign technologies to code an innovative solution that tackles a seemingly impossible challenge.

Check out the Resources tab for ideas and inspiration around each category.ÃÂ Get started building -ÃÂ API Integrations,ÃÂ Extension Apps,ÃÂ Agreement Automation.
ÃÂ 
What to SubmitÃÂ 

Build an application or integration using any Docusign API or other Docusign technology in one of the following categories: AI-ify Your World, Hack-for-Good, Making the Impossible...PossibleÃÂ 
A 5-minute demo video (hosted on YouTube, Facebook Video, Vimeo, or Youku). Your video should include a demo of your working application via a step-by-step visual demo.
A way to access your working application for judging and testing by providing a URL to the publicly visible code repository, including an applicable open source license. https://opensource.org/licenses
You must clearly disclose which code you wrote yourself within the timeframe of the hackathon and let the judges know about any libraries or APIs you used.

All projects must be submitted here through Devpost to be eligible for judging.
Submissions open at 9:00 AM PT on Thursday, November 20, 2024. Submissions close at 5:00 PM PT on January 27, 2024. Requests for late submissions will not be accepted.

      Judging Criteria
    
    
  

  
      
        Technology
        How technically impressive was the hack? Did it involve a clever technique or integrate many components? Did the effort involved make you say ""Wow""? If there's no code: Is the use of technology impressive? Is the plan for utilizing tech clearly outlined?
      
      
        Design
        Did the team put careful thought into the user experience? How well-designed is the interface? For a website, this could refer to the quality of the CSS or graphics. Is it user-friendly or does it feature an innovative interface?
      
      
        Novelty
        Does it introduce something entirely new, or at least offer a fresh perspective on an existing problem? This category will focus solely on the concept behind your project, regardless of its functionality.
      
      
        Impactfulness
        We seek hacks with significant social impact. Is the hack impactful? Does it address a genuine need that people have (UN 17 SDGs)? This category will evaluate the idea behind your project and its intended functionality, even if it's not fully operational.
      
      
        Implementability/Practicality
        We value new and original ideas. We encourage hackers to think outside the box, but also prioritize practicality. Is this project implementable within the next 3-5 years? This category will assess both the concept and functionality of your project.

        What to Build
Teams are tasked with building an Ethical AI-powered Climate Impact Visualization Platform. The platform should be capable of:


Detecting Bias in Citizen-Collected Climate Data: Implementing bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate potential biases in climate data sourced from TARTLE, a citizen science platform. The platform should utilize statistical analysis, Bayesian models, and multi-method bias correction techniques to ensure the data's reliability and address the inherent challenges of citizen-collected climate records.


Generating Explainable AI Predictions: Developing an AI model that makes climate predictions at a local level using bias-corrected data. The AI model should be transparentÃ¢ÂÂusing techniques like LIME, SHAP, or Feature Importance ScoresÃ¢ÂÂto explain how it arrives at its predictions, ensuring accessibility and clarity for users.


Visualizing Localized Climate Impacts: Creating an immersive visualization tool overlaps NOAA's public climate data with personal observations collected through TARTLE. The platform should provide a holistic view of local climate change impacts by combining scientific measurements with individual observations. To enhance user engagement and comprehension, it must feature interactive elements like heat maps, time-series charts, and geospatial mapping.


The resulting platform should adhere to ethical AI principles, focusing on data privacy, informed consent, and transparency. It should allow users to:


Explore bias-corrected citizen climate data


View AI-generated local climate predictions


Interact with visualizations that combine NOAA data and personal observations


Gain insights into how the AI model makes its predictions


Understand the local impacts of climate change through various visualization techniques


Key Requirements


Ethical AI Principles: Prioritize data privacy, informed consent, and transparency in every platform aspect.


Interactive Features: Include interactive visualizations to help users understand local climate impacts intuitively.


The Final Product Should Allow Users to:


Explore Bias-Corrected Data: Access and analyze citizen-collected climate data that has been corrected for biases.


View AI Predictions: Understand local climate predictions generated by explainable AI.


Engage with Interactive Visuals: Experience visualizations overlaying NOAA data with personal climate observations.


Gain Insights on AI Models: Understand how the AI generates predictions and the factors influencing outcomes.


Comprehend Local Climate Impacts: Clearly visualize how climate change affects their local environment.


The Challenge: Bringing Climate Data to Life
Your task is to create a platform that:


Bias Detection in Citizen-Collected Climate Data: Implement bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate potential biases in climate data sourced from the citizen science platform TARTLE. You'll leverage statistical analysis, Bayesian models, and multi-method bias correction techniques to ensure the integrity of the data, addressing potential pitfalls of citizen-collected climate records.


Explainable AI Predictions: Develop an AI model that generates local climate predictions from the bias-corrected data. The focus should be on transparencyÃ¢ÂÂusing tools like LIME, SHAP, or Feature Importance Scores to explain how the AI reaches its conclusions, making the model accessible and understandable to everyone.


Localized Climate Change Visualization: Create an immersive visualization tool that combines NOAA's public climate data with personal observations collected through TARTLE. Your tool should give a holistic view of local climate impacts by overlaying scientific measurements with individual stories. Use visual elements like heat maps, time-series charts, and geospatial mapping to engage users.

      Judging Criteria
    
    
  

  
      
        Game Play + Game Feel
        How well the game squeezes out value from its mechanics/how appropriate and appealing the controls feel (snappy platforming, impactful heavy attacks, or the like). This may differ depending on the genre of game.
      
      
        Graphics
        How impressive the project looks. Objects of importance should be easily differentiable from other objects, and in general the game should be visually appealing. 
      
      
        Innovation
        How Ã¢ÂÂnewÃ¢ÂÂ a concept in the game is (avant-garde graphics, new gameplay concepts, new interpretations or combinations of old concepts, etc.)
      
      
        Theme
        How well the game interprets the theme. The more creative the interpretation that still reasonably matches the theme, the higher the game's score in this category.
      
      
        Polish
        How little bugs/exploits there are, and overall polish/whether the game feels complete.

        Originality
        The idea for your app needs to be original and different from anything that has been done before. The more creative or surprising it is, the better you score in this area.
      
      
        Ease of Use
        The app should make it easy for the user to use it. It should be minimally intrusive. Keep in mind that things like making the app fun to use such that people want to use it, or making the app look good are both good ways of scoring points here.
      
      
        Potential Impact
        This criteria gauges how much of an impact your app is likely to have in this mission of combating ignorance.

        Previous year's challenges
Challenge #1: Happy Place Genetics Clinic
VR is one of the most rapidly advancing technologies today. It's being developed for work applications, gaming, relaxation, physical therapy, and telehealth. One of VR's advantages is that it allows remote, real-time, visual communication that can include body positioning and movement. This is especially important for those with limited mobility or challenges traveling significant distances. In modern medical practice, VR has the potential to provide a solution space to get more patients seeing specialists that they normally would not be able to see.
In genetic medicine, it's common practice to schedule patients with multiple specialists on the same day. This limits trips to the hospital, but it means patients will sit in a doctor's office examination room for multiple hours at a time while specialists of various types (cardiology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, genetics, etc.) rotate through. In this challenge, participants are asked to use VR to create an entertaining, relaxing environment that patients can enjoy while at home that also includes areas where specialists can conduct examinations of the patient, talk with family members, and consult with each other. Note that each of the above has different requirements for privacy and security. Think about how you would address those in your solution.
ÃÂ 
Challenge #2: Exploration for Astronaut Nutrition
Nutrigenomics studies how genetic variations influence responses to nutrients, which is especially important for long-duration spaceflight missions. This challenge invites participants to explore nutrigenomics, focusing on the genetic complexities of plant-based food for astronauts in space. Currently, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) receive food resupply shipments that fulfill nutritional needs. However, the degradation of vitamins over time renders carrying all nutritional necessities for deep space missions impossible and inefficient. The alternative is growing fresh produce in space, a challenge NASA is preparing for future exploration.
In Huntsville, ""The Rocket City,"" continuing the legacy of researchers with innovative ideas is crucial. This challenge does not involve solving the complexities of growing vegetables in zero gravity; instead, it focuses on determining the optimal diet for astronauts. Imagine a crew one year from a deep space mission. NASA has tasked you with a bioinformatic project to identify the optimal vegetables for each astronaut's needs in space, aiming for a report on the essential dietary requirements shared among the crew to optimize payload weight for nutritional resources. This challenge comprises two main tasks: designing a bioinformatic solution for given nutrigenomic data and providing a comprehensive report on nutritional discoveries to support future human exploration.

Challenge #3: ChaTCGA
Over the last several decades, publicly available multi-omics datasets have grown significantly. This data availability has allowed researchers to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning models to predict risk, prognosis, and therapies for many different diseases and conditions. However, there are situations where datasets are not publicly available and cannot be shared due to privacy or security concerns. Therefore, the ability to create Ã¢ÂÂmimicÃ¢ÂÂ data from these datasets and then use the mimic to train models is critical.
In this project, you will use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)Ã¢ÂÂs lung adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset as the secure source dataset. TCGA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13385. Lung cancer accounts for approximately 28% of cancer deaths, and the prognosis for patients with advanced cancer is a 16% survival rate after five years. Models that predict/classify tumor vs. normal tissue, tumor stages, or survival are all important tools for bioinformaticians and have far-reaching impacts on tools for physicians.
For this challenge, participants are asked to use an AI/ML approach to create a mimic dataset that captures the variation found within a secure source dataset, develop an AI/ML predictive model using the mimic dataset, and validate the newly developed model back on the secure source dataset.

        What to Build
Complete the Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challenge (Microsoft Fabric) and build a new Fabric solution that leverages Azure OpenAI services and falls into one of the following hackathon categories.


Hackathon Categories:


Microsoft Fabric + AI Innovation


A solution that solves a real world problem with Microsoft Fabric by implementing any concept or collection of concepts related to Artificial Intelligence.ÃÂ 


This could include a document analysis service that uses AI Skills or an Azure OpenAI based solution to implement a retrieval augmented generation architecture, training and deployment of a custom object detection model, anomaly detection, predictive forecasting, or any other modern application of AI within Microsoft Fabric. 




Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric


A solution that uses Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) in Microsoft FabricÃÂ  to solve a real world problem.ÃÂ 


RTI is all about data integration, so showcasing how you can use RTI to integrate data from multiple sources and make real-time decisions based on that data is key. Any good RTI solution would include real-time data processing, real-time analytics, real-time monitoring, real-time alerting, or any other real-time application within Microsoft Fabric.ÃÂ 


Using RTI as a source of data for your AI application is also a great way to showcase the power of RTI. Showcasing open-source integrations like Apache Kafka or AMQP, and showing cross-cloud or hybrid cloud integrations is also a plus, but not required.




Azure Database for PostgreSQL Integration


A real-world solution that uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL as an OLTP main transactional database and the transactional data has to be offloaded to Fabric for near real-time analytics. This could involve using Event streaming connector for Azure Database for PostgreSQL or other techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), Notebooks, or Data Factory Pipelines. Data landing in Fabric can be used in near real-time intelligent scenarios such as anomaly detection, predictive maintenance and other predictive scenarios, or personalized recommendations amongst others.




SQL And AI Integration


A real-world solution that is built on Microsoft Fabric that leverages Azure SQL Database or SQL Server, and augmented by AI capabilities. This could involve using Mirroring, Eventstream's Change Data Capture (CDC) Connector for Azure SQL DB, or using ingestion techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), Notebooks, Data Factory Pipelines, and AI-driven analytics and insights.

Azure Cosmos DB + Microsoft Fabric Integration


A real-world solution that is built on Microsoft Fabric, leveraging Azure Cosmos DB. This could involve using Mirroring for enabling analytics/BI on Cosmos DB data, Eventstream's Change Data Capture (CDC) Connector for Cosmos DB, or using ingestion techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), or Data Factory Pipelines.

TinyMCE (https://hackp.ac/tinymce) is a rich-text editor that allows you to create formatted content within a hacker-friendly interface. Adding a Rich Text Editor component (https://hackp.ac/tinymce-docs) has never been easier! Alongside functionality like bold, italics, underlines, hyperlinks, or titles (to name a few), the editor also allows users to enable HTML tags, MarkDown or CSS. TinyMCE even gives you the ability to edit your text elements directly with no code, similar to the way you would edit a word document but with even more practical hackathon use cases. 

TinyMCE also has dozens of plugins (https://hackp.ac/tinymce-plugins) that allow developers to customize their userÃ¢ÂÂs experience. From implementing accessibility checkers, autocorrect, and enhanced image editing to utilizing emoticons, adding responsive design with auto resize and even a ChatGPT AI Assistant. If your hackathon project accepts ANY type of text input, you can use TinyMCE to take it to the next level. 

Signup for TinyMCE for a free trial and get started today, no credit card required! To qualify for the Best Use of TinyMCE prize category, be sure to render the editor with a Tiny Cloud account for a chance to win a 3D Printing Pen for you and each of your team members!

                ServiceNow: Accelerator Recommendation Engine
                  (3)
              

            
          

          Your mission is to develop an innovative and robust recommendation engine designed to enhance our Technical Accelerators program.
At any given time, our team is developing 8-10 new Accelerators while actively delivering up to 600 ongoing projects.
The challenge is to develop a way to match customers to the Accelerators they would benefit from the most.

The core objective is to build a recommendation engine that excels in two key areas:
Ã¯Â»Â¿Ã¯Â»Â¿Ã¯Â»Â¿- Recommending New Accelerators to Existing Customers
Ã¯Â»Â¿Ã¯Â»Â¿Ã¯Â»Â¿- Recommending New Accelerators to New Customers

Your submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Accuracy and Relevance: How well the recommendation engine can match accelerators to the needs of existing customers
2. Predictive Capability: The engineÃ¢ÂÂs ability to efficiently recommend accelerators to new customers with minimal historical data.
        
    
    
        
          
            
              
                
                BNY Melon: AI-powered Financial Fraud detection System

          **Problem**: Financial fraud (e.g.ÃÂ identity theft, transaction fraud) is a persistent challenge.

**Idea**: Develop an AI model that analyzes real-time transactions to detect suspicious activity. Use historical transaction data and patterns to build a machine learning model that flags anomalies.

        Our hackathon employs a multi-metric scoring system that combines performance accuracy with real-world efficiency metrics. TheÃÂ  score (0-100) calculated as follows:
Primary Performance Metrics (60%):

Task-specific accuracy metrics (F1-score, RMSE, ROUGE/BLEU) based on each team's assigned dataset
UpdatedÃÂ  every 2 hours checkpoints to track progress

Resource Efficiency Score (40%):

Computation time (15%)
Memory usage (15%)
Scalability test performance (10%) - measured by model performance on larger data batches

ÃÂ 
Each team's total score will be automatically calculated and updated on the leaderboard during the six checkpoints. This scoring system incentivizes both high performance and practical efficiency, aligning with our goal of identifying truly production-ready solutions.

Data Driven Insights: Develop a data analysis or visualization tool that helps uncover insights about the problem and suggest actionable solutions. This could involve creating dashboards, predictive models, or visualizations that make complex data understandable and useful.


Campaigns & Educational Tools: Design a campaign, educational program, or resource that can be used to inform, educate, or mobilize communities to address the issue. This might include online courses, awareness campaigns, or social media strategies.


Sustainable Business Models: Propose a sustainable business model or social enterprise that can help solve the problem in a scalable and impactful way. Consider how your idea can be economically viable while driving positive change.

        What to Build
The 2024 Neodata Hackatania 2 focuses on AI strategies for knowledge management, specifically using graph RAG and agentic systems. Word embeddings, search algorithms, vector databases, and frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex have created a huge opportunity for improving decision-making through better knowledge management.ÃÂ 
What to build? Apply graph RAG or similar systems to an enterprise-level problem, such as how to query a large knowledge base while doing time-sensitive work, like hospital triage or emergency services. One excellent source of data you could use is https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database. Maybe try to make it easy to query the hundreds of databases available from the European government.
Or start with a RAG-based chatbot for enterprise use. Optimize your strategy for a specific use case, innovate around how to improve the quality of RAG retrieval, prompt engineering, best LLMs to use, and more. Or focus on multimodal and surface important information found in diagrams and charts, not just text. Or consider how to fine-tune an LLM with numerical data and summarize everything in one place for the user...ÃÂ 
We are open to a wide variety of submissions. The important thing is that you leverage Graph RAG technology to solve a knowledge management problem.
What to Submit
In order to judge the submission, the jury needs access to your source code (email a Github repository link to info@neodatagroup.ai), and you need to present your work briefly to the public.ÃÂ
