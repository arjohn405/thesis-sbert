      Judging Criteria
    
    
  

  
      
        Delightful UX
        Games should be intuitive and built with accessible layouts and themes. It should be exciting and easy to uncover what the app has to offer. We will be testing apps on Desktop, but encourage devs to consider the mobile layout and experience of their app.
      
      
        Relevance
        Does the app leverage the Developer Platform interactive post features to create a thought-out game? See examples of apps that use the interactive post feature here: https://developers.reddit.com/docs/showcase/apps.
      
      
        Original
        We’re not looking for simple clones of existing apps. We want these apps to have their own identity and look, or bring a new twist to a classic game. Make it sleek, make it weird, make it fun, and make it unique! 
      
      
        Uniquely suited to Reddit
        Your game should be designed to bring together a community of users. Think massively multiplayer. Make use of flair, comments, leaderboards, or other Reddit-y mechanics. See the recommended list of mechanics for more guidance on the Resources page.

          Requirements
        
        
      

      
        What to Build 
Businesses worldwide are losing valuable time, money and opportunities because agreement data is trapped in inefficient systems, hindering decision-making and delaying processes, known as the Agreement Trap. To illustrate the agreement trap, if you send Terms and Conditions to 1,000 partners or customers annually, tracking expiration dates for renewals becomes a challenge. The key lies in the data within these agreements.
Hackathon developers should create solutions that enable businesses to streamline workflows and automate processes that maximize the value of their agreement data. Your challenge: develop a project that that addresses the agreement trap in one of the following categories:

AI-ify Your World - Use AI to unlock insights from your Docusign agreements and build innovative solutions.
Hack-for-Good - Build an innovative solution with Docusign's developer platform to help a non-profit achieve its mission.
Making the Impossible...Possible - Use Docusign technologies to code an innovative solution that tackles a seemingly impossible challenge.

Check out the Resources tab for ideas and inspiration around each category. Get started building - API Integrations, Extension Apps, Agreement Automation.
 
What to Submit 

Build an application or integration using any Docusign API or other Docusign technology in one of the following categories: AI-ify Your World, Hack-for-Good, Making the Impossible...Possible 
A 5-minute demo video (hosted on YouTube, Facebook Video, Vimeo, or Youku). Your video should include a demo of your working application via a step-by-step visual demo.
A way to access your working application for judging and testing by providing a URL to the publicly visible code repository, including an applicable open source license. https://opensource.org/licenses
You must clearly disclose which code you wrote yourself within the timeframe of the hackathon and let the judges know about any libraries or APIs you used.

All projects must be submitted here through Devpost to be eligible for judging.
Submissions open at 9:00 AM PT on Thursday, November 20, 2024. Submissions close at 5:00 PM PT on January 27, 2024. Requests for late submissions will not be accepted.

LLM Agents MOOC Hackathon,"ABOUT THIS HACKATHON

This LLM Agents Hackathon, hosted by UC Berkeley RDI and in conjunction with the LLM agents MOOC, aims to bring together students, researchers, and practitioners to build and showcase innovative work in LLM agents, grow the AI agent community, and advance LLM agent technology. It is open to the public and will be held both virtually and in-person at UC Berkeley.

The hackathon is designed to have 5 tracks:

Applications Track: Building innovative LLM agent applications across diverse domains, from coding assistants to personal AI companions.
Benchmarks Track: Creating and improving benchmarks for AI agents, enabling standardized evaluation and comparison of different agent architectures and capabilities.
Fundamentals Track: Enhancing core agent capabilities such as memory, planning, reasoning, and tool use through novel frameworks and techniques.
Safety Track: Addressing critical safety concerns in AI agent deployment, including misuse prevention, privacy, interpretability, and broader societal impacts.
Decentralized and Multi-Agents Track: Advancing tools, frameworks, and applications for decentralized multi-agent systems, focusing on enhanced capabilities, interactions, and deployment.

We hope this hackathon with these specially-designed tracks can help demonstrate that we are entering a new phase of maturity and practicality of LLM agent technology where:

Every developer can learn to use LLM agent technology for building innovative applications (Applications Track)
Decentralized community collaboration can effectively bring the community together to build key technologies and infrastructure for LLM agents, serving as important foundations and public good for the community in AI (Benchmarks, Fundamentals, and Safety Tracks)

Nova Hacks offers - $24k in sponsored prizes & awards (subscriptions, certificates, coupons, etc.)

Nova Hacks 2 2024 is a hackathon/incubator centered around social good and improving the environment. It runs from (11/15-12/15). The timespan from (11/3-11/15) is purely for searching for potential teammates, but it can be done throughout the entire competition!

Our hackathon is open to all individuals and students who are in high school or above. The theme for this hackathon is ""Sustainability and Protecting the Youth"". We recommend all participants look to the UN's 17 SDGs for project ideas and inspiration.

Winners get a prestigious article that will impress employers and college admission officers! Check out an example here.

This hackathon is open internationally to all high school students and older and to students of all levels of experience. Our hackathon serves as a project incubator. An innovative idea is just as important as the coding/building itself. 

Participating in Nova Hacks 2 will allow you to build an impressive and innovative project that addresses climate change, equity, human rights, or any of the UN's 17 SDGs.

Note: If requested, legal documentation of donations that we make will be available, as the goal of Nova Hacks is to be as transparent as possible! Furthermore, donations through our link will be given a tax-deductible receipt that you/your parents can use when filing taxes.

        Technology
        How technically impressive was the hack? Did it involve a clever technique or integrate many components? Did the effort involved make you say ""Wow""? If there's no code: Is the use of technology impressive? Is the plan for utilizing tech clearly outlined?
      
      
        Design
        Did the team put careful thought into the user experience? How well-designed is the interface? For a website, this could refer to the quality of the CSS or graphics. Is it user-friendly or does it feature an innovative interface?
      
      
        Novelty
        Does it introduce something entirely new, or at least offer a fresh perspective on an existing problem? This category will focus solely on the concept behind your project, regardless of its functionality.
      
      
        Impactfulness
        We seek hacks with significant social impact. Is the hack impactful? Does it address a genuine need that people have (UN 17 SDGs)? This category will evaluate the idea behind your project and its intended functionality, even if it's not fully operational.
      
      
        Implementability/Practicality
        We value new and original ideas. We encourage hackers to think outside the box, but also prioritize practicality. Is this project implementable within the next 3-5 years? This category will assess both the concept and functionality of your project.

GTVO Hackathon,"

   
 
WHAT IS THE MISSION? 
YOU'VE HEARD OF GOTV...
THIS IS GTVO!
SIMON SAYS: GET THE VOTE OUT! 
Every election cycle, the big question echoes: Will young people show up to vote?
Recently, the answer has been a loud and clear YES!
Young voters aged 18-29 have smashed the “unreliable” stereotype with record-breaking turnout.
Between the 2014 and 2018 midterms and the 2016 to 2020 presidential elections, youth voter participation skyrocketed by double digits. In 2022, Gen Z, as the entire 18-24 age group, turned out at higher rates than any generation before them in their first eligible election.
But the work isn’t done. Youth turnout still trails behind older generations, and significant gaps remain. In 2022, Black (15%) and Latino (14%) youth turnout lagged nearly 10 percentage points behind the overall youth rate, while youth with a Bachelor’s degree outvoted their peers with only a high school diploma by a massive 30 points.
Enter the GTVO (Get the Vote Out) hackathon—a game-changing invention-based learning experience where technologists, subject-matters experts, and youth changemakers unite to create solutions that energize and activate their generation.
It’s more than a hackathon...
We are here to inspire democracy -- TOGETHER! 
Let’s build bold tools, drive change, and make sure every young voice roars at the ballot box. The future of democracy depends on it—and we’re ready to make it unstoppable!

        How impressive the project looks. Objects of importance should be easily differentiable from other objects, and in general the game should be visually appealing. 
      
      
        Innovation
        How “new” a concept in the game is (avant-garde graphics, new gameplay concepts, new interpretations or combinations of old concepts, etc.)
      
      
        Theme
        How well the game interprets the theme. The more creative the interpretation that still reasonably matches the theme, the higher the game's score in this category.
      
      
        Polish
        How little bugs/exploits there are, and overall polish/whether the game feels complete.

MindTheGap Challenge,"WELCOME TO MIND THE GAP: A HACKATHON AIMED AT FIGHTING IGNORANCE!

In the 21st century, humanity has made more progress than ever. Weather it comes to poverty, disease, quality of life, life expectancy, or any other indicator of global development, we are significantly better off than we were just a couple decades ago. Did you know that, according to Canary Media, over 85% of new electricity generation infrastructure utilizes renewable energy? That means the switch to renewables is already well underway.

There are many other examples of such surprising facts. The reason we find them surprising is that news sites and social media often produces content that focuses on negative or sensational stories. They often talk about war, crisis, and disaster, but fail to mention positive trends in society. This false perception has significant impact on society. For example, despite that statistic about climate change, there are still many people who believe climate change is inevitable. That's because they are simply unaware of what humans are doing to combat climate change. Such beliefs can be very dangerous. People who belive that climate change is inevitable, for example, are much less likely to donate to a charity that combats climate change or vote for a presidential candidate who makes climate change one of their higher priorities.

MindTheGap Challenge brings together High School students from around the world to fight such devastating ignorance. Participants will use code to build solutions that will raise awareness about topics like world poverty and climate change. This is a great opportunity for high school students who are passionate about coding and want to use their skills to build something novel that solves a real problem and has a real impact on the world. Even beyond that, this event is a great way to network with other like-minded high school students who are also passionate about coding and start networking.

Don't know how to code? We've got you covered. Throughout the challenge, we will be hosting several workshops teaching several topics. This includes basic HTML/CSS, JS frameworks, how to build a backend for your website, and even how you can build mobile apps using react native.

Don't have a team? That's ok too. When you register, you will get an invite to a discord sever where you can meet new people and form a team.

        Originality
        The idea for your app needs to be original and different from anything that has been done before. The more creative or surprising it is, the better you score in this area.
      
      
        Ease of Use
        The app should make it easy for the user to use it. It should be minimally intrusive. Keep in mind that things like making the app fun to use such that people want to use it, or making the app look good are both good ways of scoring points here.
      
      
        Potential Impact
        This criteria gauges how much of an impact your app is likely to have in this mission of combating ignorance.

        Previous year's challenges
Challenge #1: Happy Place Genetics Clinic
VR is one of the most rapidly advancing technologies today. It's being developed for work applications, gaming, relaxation, physical therapy, and telehealth. One of VR's advantages is that it allows remote, real-time, visual communication that can include body positioning and movement. This is especially important for those with limited mobility or challenges traveling significant distances. In modern medical practice, VR has the potential to provide a solution space to get more patients seeing specialists that they normally would not be able to see.
In genetic medicine, it's common practice to schedule patients with multiple specialists on the same day. This limits trips to the hospital, but it means patients will sit in a doctor's office examination room for multiple hours at a time while specialists of various types (cardiology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, genetics, etc.) rotate through. In this challenge, participants are asked to use VR to create an entertaining, relaxing environment that patients can enjoy while at home that also includes areas where specialists can conduct examinations of the patient, talk with family members, and consult with each other. Note that each of the above has different requirements for privacy and security. Think about how you would address those in your solution.
 
Challenge #2: Exploration for Astronaut Nutrition
Nutrigenomics studies how genetic variations influence responses to nutrients, which is especially important for long-duration spaceflight missions. This challenge invites participants to explore nutrigenomics, focusing on the genetic complexities of plant-based food for astronauts in space. Currently, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) receive food resupply shipments that fulfill nutritional needs. However, the degradation of vitamins over time renders carrying all nutritional necessities for deep space missions impossible and inefficient. The alternative is growing fresh produce in space, a challenge NASA is preparing for future exploration.
In Huntsville, ""The Rocket City,"" continuing the legacy of researchers with innovative ideas is crucial. This challenge does not involve solving the complexities of growing vegetables in zero gravity; instead, it focuses on determining the optimal diet for astronauts. Imagine a crew one year from a deep space mission. NASA has tasked you with a bioinformatic project to identify the optimal vegetables for each astronaut's needs in space, aiming for a report on the essential dietary requirements shared among the crew to optimize payload weight for nutritional resources. This challenge comprises two main tasks: designing a bioinformatic solution for given nutrigenomic data and providing a comprehensive report on nutritional discoveries to support future human exploration.
 
Challenge #3: ChaTCGA
Over the last several decades, publicly available multi-omics datasets have grown significantly. This data availability has allowed researchers to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning models to predict risk, prognosis, and therapies for many different diseases and conditions. However, there are situations where datasets are not publicly available and cannot be shared due to privacy or security concerns. Therefore, the ability to create “mimic” data from these datasets and then use the mimic to train models is critical.
In this project, you will use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)’s lung adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset as the secure source dataset. TCGA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13385. Lung cancer accounts for approximately 28% of cancer deaths, and the prognosis for patients with advanced cancer is a 16% survival rate after five years. Models that predict/classify tumor vs. normal tissue, tumor stages, or survival are all important tools for bioinformaticians and have far-reaching impacts on tools for physicians.
For this challenge, participants are asked to use an AI/ML approach to create a mimic dataset that captures the variation found within a secure source dataset, develop an AI/ML predictive model using the mimic dataset, and validate the newly developed model back on the secure source dataset.

Bitcoin Indonesia Hackathon,"Welcome to the Bitcoin Indonesia Hackathon, where fiat devs meet the toxic Bitcoin maximalist. This event is a call to all Bitcoin builders, thinkers, and innovators to create projects that reinforce Bitcoin's decentralized ethos. No altcoins, no distractions—just pure, Bitcoin development.
This hackathon will challenge participants to push the boundaries of what's possible on Bitcoin Layer 1 and Layer 2 (Lightning Network) while staying true to Bitcoin's core values: decentralization, security, and censorship resistance.

 

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
To help you succeed during the hackathon, we've compiled a list of essential tools, tutorials, and technical support links to guide your journey
Bitcoin Core
Lightning Network Developer Resources
Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)
Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)
Taproot and Schnorr

 

TUTORIALS & LEARNING RESOURCES
Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos 
Lightning Labs Developer Guide

 

TECH SUPPORT CHANNELS
Hackathon Discord (Event-Specific): Link to be provided upon registration.
 
KEY PRINCIPLES FOR PARTICIPANTS
Focus: Build on Bitcoin only. No tokens, no shitcoins—just Bitcoin.
Innovation: Aim to create projects that advance Bitcoin's utility, privacy, or accessibility.
Collaboration: Work with fellow Bitcoiners to create something extraordinary.
Open Source: Contribute your code to the Bitcoin community.

The below website does not have Lightning Network visualiser. It would be great to have Lightning Network visualizer somehow integrated into the website:

https://vis-btc.btcln.app/v/btc

This is forked from https://txstreet.com
Besides this we also accept solutions to real world problems in Indonesia. Examples are Lightning to Go-pay or bank account solutions within the legal framework. Any bitcoin project is welcomed.

 

PRIZES

1,000,000 sats in prizes which will be divided into 3 winners:
1st winner 600,000 sats
2nd winner 200,000 sats
3rd winner 200,000 sats
 
HACKATHON IDEAS
1. Bitcoin Lightning Browser Extension: Let's make a friendly browser add-on that lets you pay with Bitcoin lightning-fast on any website. Click, zap, paid! Who needs those other shitcoins when you've got the original coin.
 
2. Tip Your Streamers with Bitcoin: Help fans send Bitcoin tips to their favorite TikTok and Twitch stars. Simple, fun, and direct—because real supporters use real sound money, not some flashy cripto tokens.
 
3. Bitcoin Meets Mobile Pay: What if paying with Bitcoin was as easy as using Apple Pay or Google Pay? This is well needed in Indonesia.
 
4. Print-Your-Own Bitcoin QR Codes: Merchants can print their own Bitcoin QR codes with ease. No fuss, no complicated setups. Compnies like Fedi already has this in their pipeline we are sure, but why wait for them to build it? Let's get to work now.
 
5. Reliable Bitcoin-Rupiah Rates API: Build a solid, free API that gives real-time Bitcoin to Rupiah exchange rates. Trustworthy data—unlike those unpredictable altcoins.
 
6. Bitcoin Joins GoPay and Banks: Connect Bitcoin payments with GoPay and local banks. Then we ask the prezidents to accept bitcoin for their services to citizens.


7. Bitcoin Plugin for Online Shops: Create a plugin for Shopify and WooCommerce so stores can accept Bitcoin effortlessly. Skip the shitcoin clutter and keep it simple.
 
8. Direct Bitcoin Trading Platform: Set up a place where people trade Bitcoin for Rupiah peer-to-peer. No middlemen, no nonsense—just pure zaps.
 
9. Micro-Payments for Digital Content: Pay tiny amounts of Bitcoin to read articles, listen to tunes, or watch videos. Every Satoshi counts.
 
10. Fun Bitcoin Learning App: Make an app that teaches people about Bitcoin with games and easy lessons. Who needs to study a hundred shitcoins when one Bitcoin changes everything?
 
11. Easy Bitcoin Remittance Service: Send money overseas using Bitcoin—fast and cheap.

THE AI SUMMIT NEW YORK HACKATHON,"ABOUT THE CHALLENGE

The world is evolving rapidly, with new technologies pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Fetch.ai challenges you to explore the power of AI Agents in solving real-world problems across various domains like the automotive and financial industries. Your task is to apply intelligent agent-based technology from Fetch.ai to one of the following areas, addressing critical issues in sustainability, education, interactive media, and healthcare.

 

Sustainability Challenge: Design an AI Agent that optimizes energy consumption and efficiency for smart vehicles. The agent should analyze driving patterns, vehicle health, and external factors such as traffic and weather to reduce the overall carbon footprint. It must securely share data between public and private entities, ensuring sensitive information remains confidential. Consider how this data-sharing can improve the sustainability of transportation networks by promoting energy-efficient practices and reducing environmental impact.

 

Education Challenge: Develop an AI Agent that personalizes educational content and feedback based on a user's learning history and preferences while adhering to standardized curricula. The agent should ensure the secure management and sharing of educational data across various platforms, protecting sensitive information. Additionally, explore how the agent can balance personalization with maintaining educational standards and how it can adapt to different learning environments to enhance educational outcomes.

 

Interactive Media Challenge: Create an AI Agent that curates, sorts, and presents user-generated content, such as reviews and recommendations, for specific points of interest like restaurants, tourist attractions, or service providers. The agent should be able to filter through vast amounts of data to deliver the most relevant and credible information to users. It should also adapt its recommendations based on the user's past interactions and preferences, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the information shared.

 

Healthcare Challenge: Innovate an AI Agent designed to assist in emergency situations, such as vehicle crashes or high-stress driving conditions. The agent should quickly assess the situation, provide real-time guidance, and securely share vital information, such as the vehicle's location and occupants' health data, with emergency responders. Your solution should prioritize maintaining user privacy and ensuring that sensitive health information is only shared with authorized parties.

        What to Build
Choose one of these areas and leverage Fetch.ai's powerful tools to build your solution. You can use uAgents, which come with built-in capabilities for secure transactions and storage, making them ideal for creating autonomous agents that can perform tasks seamlessly within Fetch.ai's ecosystem. Alternatively, you can use the Fetch.ai SDK, which allows for easy integration with other agentic frameworks and enables you to register agents on Agentverse for discoverability by other agents on the Fetch.ai network. While the SDK does not provide built-in storage or transaction capabilities, it offers greater flexibility for custom solutions. Select the approach that best fits your vision and bring your ideas to life with Fetch.ai's technology!

Theme Statement
Communities thrive when everyone has the tools to succeed—but for individuals with disabilities, many challenges still persist. From accessibility barriers to the need for assistive technologies, these hurdles can limit independence and opportunity. This year’s theme, Limitless, invites participants to reimagine inclusivity by crafting innovative solutions that empower people with disabilities to overcome these barriers.
Your challenge is to identify specific issues faced by individuals or organizations supporting this community and develop groundbreaking technologies that address these needs. Whether it’s designing adaptive tools, improving accessibility, or creating inclusive platforms, your work has the power to make a real impact.
We encourage you to share your solutions with the individuals or organizations who inspired them, ensuring your ideas contribute directly to a brighter, more inclusive world. Through this hackathon, you’ll not only sharpen your skills but also make a tangible difference in the lives of others. Let’s make a future without limits—together!

UGAHacks X,"

  What is UGAHacks?
UGAHacks is UGAHacks' annual 36-hour hackathon event that is centered around software development and innovation in tech. Our hackers will collaborate on software solutions, create prototypes, design innovative projects that exemplify their passion for development, all while building a relationship with the tech community. Whether our hackers indulge in our many workshops, side events, or challenges, we encourage our hackers to step out of their comfort zone and explore new horizons of creativity, innovation, and personal growth!
Theme and Focus

With the theme of Rock n' Roll, UGAHacks X is where hackers can unleash their inner rockstar! Inspired by the rebellious spirit of the rock n' roll movement, we celebrate breaking the mold and embracing bold, unconventional ideas. Just like rock n' roll challenged norms and created a new wave of artistic expression, we encourage hackers to push boundaries, think outside the box, and create solutions that are as innovative as they are daring. Whether you're here to build your portfolio, network with sponsors, or connect with a passionate community, UGAHacks X is your stage to showcase your unique rhythm and make some noise!
A place for everyone 
The UGAHacks organization prides itself on our beginner friendly environment. Our ultimate goal is showing others the wonders of building their first project and watching it come alive, or even inspiring them to take their first steps toward their greatness. Through the workshops we host before, during, and after the event, mini-events, and additional resources we provide hackers to enhance ideas and their projects, hackers are made to feel comfortable to thrive in this growing community.

        What to Build
Complete the Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challenge (Microsoft Fabric) and build a new Fabric solution that leverages Azure OpenAI services and falls into one of the following hackathon categories.


Hackathon Categories:


Microsoft Fabric + AI Innovation


A solution that solves a real world problem with Microsoft Fabric by implementing any concept or collection of concepts related to Artificial Intelligence. 


This could include a document analysis service that uses AI Skills or an Azure OpenAI based solution to implement a retrieval augmented generation architecture, training and deployment of a custom object detection model, anomaly detection, predictive forecasting, or any other modern application of AI within Microsoft Fabric. 




Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric


A solution that uses Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) in Microsoft Fabric  to solve a real world problem. 


RTI is all about data integration, so showcasing how you can use RTI to integrate data from multiple sources and make real-time decisions based on that data is key. Any good RTI solution would include real-time data processing, real-time analytics, real-time monitoring, real-time alerting, or any other real-time application within Microsoft Fabric. 


Using RTI as a source of data for your AI application is also a great way to showcase the power of RTI. Showcasing open-source integrations like Apache Kafka or AMQP, and showing cross-cloud or hybrid cloud integrations is also a plus, but not required.




Azure Database for PostgreSQL Integration


A real-world solution that uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL as an OLTP main transactional database and the transactional data has to be offloaded to Fabric for near real-time analytics. This could involve using Event streaming connector for Azure Database for PostgreSQL or other techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), Notebooks, or Data Factory Pipelines. Data landing in Fabric can be used in near real-time intelligent scenarios such as anomaly detection, predictive maintenance and other predictive scenarios, or personalized recommendations amongst others.




SQL And AI Integration


A real-world solution that is built on Microsoft Fabric that leverages Azure SQL Database or SQL Server, and augmented by AI capabilities. This could involve using Mirroring, Eventstream's Change Data Capture (CDC) Connector for Azure SQL DB, or using ingestion techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), Notebooks, Data Factory Pipelines, and AI-driven analytics and insights.

Meta Horizon Creator Competition: Short Loop Mobile Worlds,"Meta Horizon is a next-generation immersive social and spatial platform that makes it possible for people to spend meaningful time together even when they’re apart. As you have seen throughout this year, mobile is an important priority for us. We’re committed to making it easier for people to express themselves, play, progress, and hangout.

We are inviting creators to build worlds for Meta Horizon that mobile users will love and offer interactive engagement in short, captivating loops. These worlds should be easy to navigate in quick bursts, allowing visitors to make progress in 5-minute sessions or less. Progress can be defined as achieving a goal, overcoming a challenge, completing an action that results in change or improvement, or defeating an opponent.

We look forward to seeing the amazing worlds you will create!

Consider how playing on different devices can offer related experiences of the same world. There’s heaps to explore in this area.

          Your mission is to develop an innovative and robust recommendation engine designed to enhance our Technical Accelerators program.
At any given time, our team is developing 8-10 new Accelerators while actively delivering up to 600 ongoing projects.
The challenge is to develop a way to match customers to the Accelerators they would benefit from the most.

The core objective is to build a recommendation engine that excels in two key areas:
﻿﻿﻿- Recommending New Accelerators to Existing Customers
﻿﻿﻿- Recommending New Accelerators to New Customers

Your submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Accuracy and Relevance: How well the recommendation engine can match accelerators to the needs of existing customers
2. Predictive Capability: The engine’s ability to efficiently recommend accelerators to new customers with minimal historical data.

  Our Theme
This year, our theme “Connect” is all about building bridges between ideas, people and possibilities. Connection is a core part of game development, whether you are connecting with friends across your favorite titles or connecting to servers in order to play the games you love. We want to focus on creating meaningful connections that go beyond this event. This includes connecting with your new teams, but also networking, making friends, meeting industry celebrities. Our theme is meant to be open ended because we want to see where you take this, and what type of connections you want to make.

Future of transportation sub-challenge 

Background: 

As students, we face various transportation challenges daily. The main problems are unavailability, poor quality of transportation means, high costs, and inconvenient timing. But have you ever wondered what other transportation problems might arise in the future? This is where you're going to shine, partners!

Objectives:  

Your task is to imagine a future scenario (before the year 2050) where a problem arises in the area of transportation and create a solution that uses AI to solve that specific problem. Try to build your scenarios on credible resources like United Nations or World Bank websites etc . Please note that we have put a list that could help you.

Potential Considerations: 

You may (but are not required to) consider the following when creating your solution:

What role could autonomous vehicles play in reshaping our cities and daily commutes?

How might changing work patterns (like remote work) influence transportation demands?

What new technologies might emerge that could revolutionize how we move people and goods?

How could transportation systems evolve to be more inclusive and accessible to all?

Future of security sub-challenge 

Background: 

Security is, according to the Cambridge dictionary, the protection of people, organizations, countries, etc. against a possible attack or other crime. It also means, in the context of IT, banking and the internet, the protection of information against being stolen or used wrongly or illegally. As citizens, we face various security challenges daily. The main problems are theft, moral and physical violence, rape and sexual harrassment, etc… But have you ever wondered what other security problems might arise in the future? This is where you're going to shine, partners!

Objectives:  

Your task is to imagine a future scenario (before the year 2050) where a problem arises in the area of security and create a solution that uses AI to solve that specific problem. Try to build your scenarios on credible resources like United Nations or World Bank websites etc . Please note that we have put a list that could help you.

Potential Considerations:  

You may (but are not required to) consider the following when creating your solution: - How might emerging technologies create new security vulnerabilities or threats?

Don’t forget that security encompasses physical safety, cybersecurity and national security. Think beyond current security paradigms. The most innovative solutions often come from anticipating threats we haven't yet encountered!

Future of energy sub-challenge

Background: 

As Tunisian citizens, we face various energy challenges daily. The main problems are unavailability, power outages that happen frequently, high costs, and limited resources. But have you ever wondered what other energy problems might arise in the future? This is where you're going to shine, partners!

Objectives: 

Your task is to imagine a future scenario (before the year 2050) where a problem arises in the area of energy and create a solution that uses AI to solve that specific problem. Try to build your scenarios on credible resources like United Nations or World Bank websites etc . Please note that we have put a list that could help you.

Potential Considerations: 

How might climate change impact our energy production and consumption patterns?

What role could AI play in managing smart grids and optimizing energy distribution?

How might new technologies change the way we store and transport energy?

What challenges might arise as we transition to renewable energy sources?

How could energy systems evolve to be more resilient to natural disasters or cyber threats?

What new energy sources might we discover or develop by 2050?

Put in mind that the future of energy isn't just about electricity. It encompasses all forms of power generation, distribution, storage, and consumption

Future of environment sub-challenge 

Background: 

Environmental challenges confront us daily. While pollution, resource scarcity, and climate change dominate current discussions, it's worth considering what new ecological issues may emerge in the future. This is where you're going to shine, partners!

Objectives:  

Your task is to imagine a future scenario (before the year 2050) where a problem arises in the area of the environment and create a solution that uses AI to solve that specific problem. Try to build your scenarios on credible resources like United Nations or World Bank websites etc . Please note that we have put a list that could help you.

Potential Considerations:  

You may (but are not required to) consider the following when creating your solution:

What new ecosystems might develop due to climate change or human intervention?

How could AI help monitor and manage these novel environments?

What resources might become critically scarce by 2050?

Dotslash,"Tools and Resources

Projects involving physical hardware or external devices are not permitted.
Teams can freely choose tools, IDEs, and programming languages that suit their project requirements. Game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine etc. are permitted, as well as AI tools for code generation or testing, provided their usage is disclosed in the README file.
Open-source tools, APIs, and libraries are encouraged, but proper attribution is mandatory. 
Teams must cite all third-party resources in their submissions, clearly indicating their sources and how they contributed to the project. 
Failure to disclose such information can lead to disqualification. 
Any cloned GitHub repositories or pre-existing assets must also be explicitly mentioned in the README, adhering to licensing terms like MIT or GPL. 
Pre-designed graphics, icons, and other assets may be used if they comply with Creative Commons or equivalent licensing standards.
Development must begin only after the hackathon officially starts at 10 a.m. on Saturday, November 23, 2024. 
Teams may brainstorm ideas beforehand but cannot write code prior to the event. 
The use of pre-existing libraries and APIs is allowed if properly disclosed. 

GitHub Setup and Organization

The organisers will provide a GitHub repository which must be forked. All work done by teams must be uploaded in their respective fork. Each team's repository must be well organised and conatin the following

A README.md file containing project details, technologies used, and citations for any open-source libraries or cloned repositories.
A PROGRESS.md file to log updates, challenges, and planned next steps.

Teams are encouraged to follow a structured branching strategy. The main branch should be reserved for production-ready code, the dev branch for active development, and feature-specific branches for tasks such as feature-login or feature-database. All merges into the main branch should occur via pull requests after a code review.

Documentation and Logs

Each project repository must include a well-maintained README.md file with a clear overview of the project, setup instructions, technologies used, and acknowledgments for external contributions. A PROGRESS.md file should document daily progress, challenges faced, and upcoming tasks, ensuring mentors can track the team’s journey and provide assistance when needed.

Workflow and Collaboration

Teams are encouraged to use GitHub Issues for task management, logging bugs, feature requests, and progress updates. Labels like ""bug,"" ""feature,"" or ""help wanted"" should be used to ensure clarity, with the “Help Needed” label specifically signalling mentors for support. Visualising workflows through GitHub Project Boards with columns such as ""To Do,"" ""In Progress,"" and ""Done"" is highly recommended. Tools like GitKraken or Sourcetree can aid in visualising branch merges and commit histories.

Progress Tracking and Mentor Engagement

Organizers and mentors will use GitHub Insights to monitor commit frequency, pull requests, and issue resolution. Teams must maintain clear task assignments and provide regular updates in their logs and project boards. Mentors will periodically review activity and offer guidance based on the logged progress and identified bottlenecks.

Good Practices for Development

Clear and concise code commenting is essential, particularly for complex logic or function definitions. Dependency management should include a requirements.txt file listing all necessary libraries and tools, simplifying setup for reviewers and teammates. Regularly testing the environment setup ensures that the README instructions are accurate and complete.

Fetch's AI Agent Hackathon IIT PATNA ,"INTRODUCTION

Fetch.ai’s vision is to create a marketplace of dynamic applications. We are empowering developers to build on our platform that can connect services and APIs without any domain knowledge.

Our infrastructure enables ‘search and discovery’ and ‘dynamic connectivity’. It offers an open, modular, UI agnostic, self-assembling of services.

Our technology is built on four key components:

Agents - AI Agents are independent decision-makers that connect to the network and other agents. These agents can represent data, APIs, services, ML models and people.

Agentverse - serves as a development and hosting platform for these agents.

AI Engine – enables humans to interact with the dynamic agent marketplace using natural language to execute the objective.

Fetch Network - underpins the entire system, ensuring smooth operation and integration.

CHALLENGE STATEMENT

Build a solid application using uAgents using custom frontend.

OR

Build a solid solution (chained integrations) that works on DeltaV.

Beyond the Hype—LLMs vs. Traditional ML in the Real World,"

  Are Large Language Models (LLMs) really the future of enterprise AI, or are we caught in the hype? Join us for a groundbreaking 12-hour hackathon that puts both LLMs and traditional ML approaches to the test in real-world corporate scenarios. Teams will tackle challenging tasks across genomics, time series, financial data, and NLP domains under realistic constraints – because the real world doesn't always give you unlimited GPUs and perfect datasets.
 
What makes this hackathon unique? You'll be part of a structured comparative study that will shape how companies approach AI solutions. Teams will be specifically assigned to either LLM or traditional ML approaches, working with diverse datasets under varying time and resource constraints. Whether you're a data scientist, ML engineer, researcher, or graduate student, join us to discover what really works in AI beyond the hype!

Soario X Karmeq: Apps for Finance Hackathon,"Welcome to Soario and Karmeq's 2024 Finance Hackathon! During the last week of November and first week of December, hackers from around the world will compete to build finance-centered applications to solve the biggest problems in fintech. Their submissions will then be judged from industry professionals and students at top CS programs such as Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, & more. 

Students can work solo or in teams to develop their application. We don’t restrict hackathon participants on what tools, frameworks, or platforms they chose to build on. However, all participants for this hackathon must sign up to Karmeq to officially register (this is the stock gifting platform that we distribute prizes on). This is completely free and takes less than two minutes.

Join us for this exciting hackathon where you can show off your skills, connect with like-minded peers, and have fun along the way!

WQCC x IBM Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon 2024,"ABOUT THE CHALLENGE

The Wisconsin Quantum Computing Club has partnered with IBM to bring you Madison's first Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon! This is a two component hackathon pairing challenge notebooks from IBM with an open project submission where you can strive to design an innovate and unique quantum invention using Qiskit! Upon successful completion of certain portions of the hackathon, you will earn an official certificate, and the chance to win some awesome prizes (over $300 in total value)!

GET STARTED

Set up your environment! We interface with Qiskit and quantum computing libraries through Python. You may do this locally, or you may sign into the IBM Quantum Lab (see instructions here). Once you've situated yourself, prepare to dive in!

We will have Qiskit Mentors available throughout the entire session to help you with anything you need!


Qiskit Notebooks Challenge

In partnership with IBM, we present three challenge Jupyter notebooks that contain skeleton code and an autograder. They increase in difficulty: easy, medium and advanced. The race is on, for the first person to complete and submit all three gets a prize!

Upon successful completion of each challenge notebook, you will be entered in for a drawing for some Qiskit swag and prizes. You can earn up to 6 entries if you complete all three challenge notebooks. Notebook 1 earns 1 entry, notebook 2 earns 2 entries, and notebook 3 earns 3 entries. If you complete at least challenge notebook 1, you will earn the official certificate.

Open Project Challenge

For those who crave more of a challenge, this portion of the hackathon allows you to get creative and submit a Qiskit project of your choosing. This is the perfect opportunity to create a project that you can showcase on your resume and LinkedIn.

To be eligible for prizes, you must be willing to present your project at the Qiskit Fall Fest Closing Ceremony. You may still submit your project for a certificate, but you will not be eligible for prizes.

 Projects will be judged by the WQCC executive board and a panel of Quantum Computing graduate students.

CSC Projects Program Fall 2024,"

  Project Program is a 2 month-long event to work on a project with peers and gain mentorship experience! In contrast to a hackathon, we provide structure and guidance through mentorship, co-working sessions (with food!), and a final demo day. This is great for anyone new to coding and wants to learn, has trouble sticking to a project, wants to find a team to build out their idea, or just wants to work with people to create something cool.
This Devpost has been created for you to display and catalogue your projects. It will be open throughout the entire duration of this program.
There will be an in-person Demo Day where you will showcase your project to other teams + meet other teams (w/ refreshments).

        What to Build
The 2024 Neodata Hackatania 2 focuses on AI strategies for knowledge management, specifically using graph RAG and agentic systems. Word embeddings, search algorithms, vector databases, and frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex have created a huge opportunity for improving decision-making through better knowledge management. 
What to build? Apply graph RAG or similar systems to an enterprise-level problem, such as how to query a large knowledge base while doing time-sensitive work, like hospital triage or emergency services. One excellent source of data you could use is https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database. Maybe try to make it easy to query the hundreds of databases available from the European government.
Or start with a RAG-based chatbot for enterprise use. Optimize your strategy for a specific use case, innovate around how to improve the quality of RAG retrieval, prompt engineering, best LLMs to use, and more. Or focus on multimodal and surface important information found in diagrams and charts, not just text. Or consider how to fine-tune an LLM with numerical data and summarize everything in one place for the user... 
We are open to a wide variety of submissions. The important thing is that you leverage Graph RAG technology to solve a knowledge management problem.
What to Submit
In order to judge the submission, the jury needs access to your source code (email a Github repository link to info@neodatagroup.ai), and you need to present your work briefly to the public.

CultureHack 2024,"WELCOME TO CULTUREHACK 2024!

CultureHack 2024 is here to ignite your creativity! Hosted by KCL Tech in collaboration with KCL Enactus, this unique hackathon invites students from diverse backgrounds to design digital solutions that reshape the arts and creative industries.

Working closely with the Department of Culture, Media and Creative Industries (CMCI), selected CMCI students will propose real-world challenges and ideas for enhancing the digital landscape of the cultural sector. These ideas will then be handed over to KCL Tech to assemble interdisciplinary teams of participants.

How It Works:

Each CMCI student will pitch a visionary project concept centered on transforming cultural experiences or addressing industry challenges. From these ideas, teams of 4 will be created, with each team guided by the original CMCI student who proposed the project.

Teams will have 7 hours to develop a compelling proof of concept, which could take the form of:

A detailed Figma design
An interactive app prototype
A well-researched slide deck
Any creative solution that brings the idea to life

Teams will present their concepts in a pitch session, showcasing their vision and approach for a digital cultural innovation.","

Open Source Solutions for YBS Farming,"
    
  




  About the challenge
Based on the literature, Agriculture 4.0 is critical to address a number of challenges (e.g., Sustainability, Lower cost of inputs, Feeding a growing world population). Large and corporate farms usually have the scale to integrate and operate the sophisticated technologies, business processes, etc. required to take full advantage of Agriculture 4.0. Not so much for YBS farmers and, arguably, even less so for the under-represented communities. To remove this barrier for YBS and under-represented communities, we investigated Open-Source Software where there are no license charges that would be far more affordable (and more data privacy for those who have that concern).

  **Must fill out registration form to participate 
**Teams are randomly assigned on Day 1 of the event
This 3-day hacking event challenges participants to create and to innovate solutions to local and global issues. While this year’s participant team tracks are Energy, Conflict, and Mental Health, all finished products in this team competition must embody at least 3 of these 7 Humanity 101 principles: kindness, compassion, integrity, respect, empathy, forgiveness, and self-reflection.
This unique annual event draws some 150-200 participants–students, faculty, staff, professionals, and community members.
WHERE? This year’s event is IN-PERSON  at 1951 @ Skysong
1475 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85257
WHEN? 11, 12, 13 October 2024 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). 
EXPECT: prizes, games, networking, community-building, FUN!
Check out our website at https://www.hacksforhumanity.io/

What is Hacks for Humanity, and what makes it unique? 
Unlike many such hacking events, Hacks for Humanity invites participants from a wide skillset, even those who have no previous “hacking” experience. We welcome artists, coders, app makers, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, humanists, creatives, and generalists; indeed everyone in between from high school to professional retirement.
Hosted by Project Humanities at Arizona State University, Hacks for Humanity–a 3-day competitive online hacking event for the social good–is different in these ways:

Targets not just coders but rather to coders, non-coders and everyone in between.
Involves both communities inside and beyond Arizona State University and brings together individuals across professions, disciplines, generations, and around the globe.
Innovates products that connect with or embody at least 3 of these 7 principles Project Humanities deems Humanity 101: compassion, empathy, respect, integrity, forgiveness, self-reflection and kindness.
Features 3 thematic tracks under the umbrella of Humanity 101. This year the three tracks are Energy, Conflict, and Mental Health.


How does Hacks for Humanity work logistically?

Individuals register online as a participant, volunteer, or mentor, and self-identify with one of the designated expertise areas (business, design, humanist, engineering, generalist, etc.). 
On the evening of the event commencement, atendees will form their teams during the mandatory opening plenary in Scottsdale, Arizona

Participants will be randomly assigned to a team based on a diverse set of expertise areas. Teams consist of 3-5 members. No pre-assembled teams allowed. A goal of this hacking event is to get people to work across the lines of the everyday and the familiar. In other words, we want teams to mix and match rather than teams of all graduate students, all undergraduates, all community members, all males, all from a single school, etc.

When teams are formed, the hacking begins with guidelines and milestones provided by the event coordinators.
All team members must be an active team member throughout the event in order to be eligible to receive prizes.
Teams are required to attend event plenaries and must send at least one team member to attend each workshop. 
The hacking event ends with each team pitching its product and judges determining the top teams for awards and prizes.

Bridge The Gap Hackathon,"

  About the challenge
Did you know that the median net worth of a U.S.-born Black household in Boston is only $8, compared to $247,000 for White households (https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/color-of-wealth.aspx)? This staggering disparity is why we're calling on you to help bridge the gap. Through this hackathon, we hope that you will join us in developing projects that can create lasting change and uplift the Black community in our city.
Get started
Join us the weekend of September 20th to the 22nd to create solutions that can contribute to this prevaling issue.

        What to Build
Submit a website, app, chrome extension, data visualization, or any other project that you think can make a genuine impact. Solutions will be evaluated based on creativity, so we are giving you the freedom to create whatever you think will make a difference. For inspiration, one project that has been done in a previous year at HackMIT was Rate My Protector, an app where people can give ratings and reviews for their local police department. Another idea that came out of MIT was Birth By Us, a social impact startup that came out of the PKG IDEAS challenge which gives support to pregnant and postpartum Black women. Finally, New Majority Capital is another startup that came out of MIT and the PKG IDEAS challenge, and they seek to empower minorities to become businesses owners through Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition.
What to Submit
Your submission should be a video demo of your project, with an explanation of the motivation behind the project and how you think it can make a difference. You should also give a high level overview of how you developed the project and how it works. The video should be around 2-7 minutes long.

European Blockchain Convention HACKATHON,"

  This Hackathon is organised by the European Blockchain Convention, whose 10th edition will be from September 25-26 here in Barcelona.
It is completely free to apply to the Hackathon and the topics are Blockchain, Crypto and DeFi (decentralised finance).
The sponsor of this Hackathon is Radix (radixdlt.com). Radix DLT is a pioneering layer one protocol dedicated to building a decentralised, scalable, and secure foundation for the next generation of decentralised applications (dApps). With a mission to unlock the potential of decentralised finance (DeFi), Radix DLT focuses on providing a high-performance, developer-friendly, and user-centric platform that overcomes the limitations of existing blockchain solutions.
 What to build 



Consider building dApps in high-potential categories:



Lending & Borrowing Money Markets


Real World Assets (RWA)


Yield Derivatives


NFT Pro Trading


Launchpad


Stablecoins & Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)


Liquid Staking & Restaking



Get ideas from the Scrypto Challenges repository, with a wide variety of projects about DEXes, Oracles, Lending, Portfolio Management, DAOs, NFTs for financial apps, DeFi, and yield derivatives projects.


Scrypto Community Scrypto Examples, a place where the community has uploaded their examples, many of which have earned the £1500 Dev Incentive for impressing the team.


Are you up to build for yield derivatives? Check out our latest Yield Derivatives Challenge boilerplate inspired by Pendle Finance, which was helpful for the latest Scrypto challenge.


Get inspired by the Value Prop database: The Value Prop highlights a wide range of blockchain-based Internet applications across various sectors, including social impact, education, and security. These applications have been making a positive difference in people's lives globally.

          Requirements
        
        
      

      
         Evaluation Criteria 



Use of Radix Tech Stack: The project must be Scrypto package (composed of blueprints) deployed on Stokenet and a frontend integrated with Radix dApp Toolkit.


Quality and Asset-Orientedness of Code: Assess the participant's skill in applying asset-oriented programming principles from our docs and design patterns where it’s applicable.


Breadth of Functionality: Rate the range of functionalities provided in the submission and their utility. Especially if it's a novel or more complex functional of common DeFi dApps - e.g. a Uniswap V2 DEX is less interesting than something like a Balancer type dApp or Uniswap V3.


Quality of Documentation and Code Comments: Evaluate the clarity, thoroughness, and usefulness of documentation and comments within the code.


Transaction Manifest: Evaluate the use and understanding of the transaction manifest.


UI/UX Experience: Assess the proficiency with which the participants utilise a frontend framework.


Innovation and Creativity: Evaluate the level of innovation and creativity displayed in the project’s approach and solutions.


All skills are welcome and needed. The hackathon is open to all profiles, but every team will require at least one developer to submit an MVP for judging.
All participants should sign-up individually, regardless of team formation, which will take place briefly prior to the hackathon kick-off. Hackers can encourage their desired teammates to apply so they can all join the hackathon as a single group. Teams are not expected to be formed by more than 4 participants.
Food and beverages will be provided by the organisation.
Judging is done by the Radix team based on judging and acceptance criteria of the challenges.

Opportunities to turn your causality-powered solution into a full fledged and monetized product of your own
​Experiences showcased in the causality app
​WHO

​Developers and non-devs of all levels.

​Coding is required at this event.

​Beginners are welcome! The minimum requirement is understanding how to use API calls.

​We encourage teams! If you’re not a dev please make sure to note your teammates when prompted during registration.

​There must be at least one dev capable of coding on every team (if you're hacking solo - that must be you)

​HOW
​Request to join through Luma.
We’re accepting participants on a rolling basis, looking for those who can hack as well as they can party.
Upon acceptance you’ll receive an email with credentials to your complimentary causality account (for studying/experimenting with before the event) as well as info on where to pick up test NFC tags in the NYC area if you want to be fully prepared.
On event day, you’ll arrive, mingle, eat and be presented with the Challenge Statement. Then we’ll blow the whistle and you’ll start creating physical-digital solutions for it using causality.

The Unhackable Hack at Pebblebed,"Let's build something unbreakable!

 

At The Unhackable Hack, you’ll develop secure, compliant-ready APIs or microservices using AI-generated code (powered by Claude). We’ll give you plug-and-play templates, and you’ll add your creative touch to make it both powerful and secure.

​This isn’t your typical hackathon. With industry leaders sharing insights, top-tier tech, and hands-on challenges, you’ll push the limits of what’s possible with AI-generated code. Plus, we’ve got AirPods for the most creative project (chosen by the judge), smart speakers for the most secure project (scanned by Vidoc's security checks), and tons of swag for the participants.

​Join us for a day of serious innovation, collaboration, and fun. Think you can build the unhackable? Let’s find out!

​​We’ll also be serving dinner and refreshments throughout the event, so come ready to code, connect, and get fed!

Ponderosa Hacks,"

  Whether you are into Computer Science, Engineering, Art, Medicine, or anything else, this hackathon is for you! With hours to brainstorm, create, and model, you will present your project to a panel of judges for a chance to win cool prizes. During the day, we will provide food, snacks, activities to earn prizes, skills workshops to help with your project, and free goodies from our sponsors.
Even though our event is called a hackathon, your brain is the only thing you'll be hacking. If you can code, feel free to write programs or program a solution for your project. And if you can't code, don't worry! You'll be at no disadvantage. You can utilize any of your skills or passions to create your project. You can make a prototype of a physical device, build a website (we'll have a workshop teaching you how), a game, or anything you can think of. We'll have volunteers and people knowledgeable in engineering, computer science, and other topics to help you with your project. Come with a team or find one at the event.
Everything begins with an IDEA.
